- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevCrusader
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to web-programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Django in particular, learning the basics of SQL in MS SQL Server, have little knowledge of front-end development and I'm very interested in all of this :)
- 💞️ I don't have any experience in web development at the moment, but I'm actively looking for it :D
- 📫 I have a working email: yapryntsev.a02@mail.ru
